# Leet_Code_Challenge
Hi Everyone,
I've been leetcoding for a little while now and I've put together a list of problems I though were incredibly easy. I feel like leetcode could probably use a "super easy" filter because some questions marked "easy" can be surprisingly complex.

Because of that, I don't think there is an easy way for people looking for simple problems; either to learn and get used to a new language syntax or if they are a beginner trying to learn how to code.

I hope this list is helpful for anyone trying to learn something new. I'll keep updating it as I run into more problems.

This is all the leetcode problems that i have solved that you can refer to. Hopefully , this is useful for you!!!
